I had the opportunity to review your game code, and I must say that you've done a great job with it. Your use of Node.js to build this game is impressive, and I appreciate the effort you put into it. I'll provide some feedback on the code you shared.

Firstly, it's good to see that you have organized your code into separate files and imported the necessary modules using `require`. This approach promotes modularity and makes your code more maintainable.

I noticed that you have set up an Express server and defined routes to handle different endpoints. This is a good practice for building web applications. You've also correctly used middleware like `express.static` and `express.urlencoded` to handle static files and parse URL-encoded data, respectively.

Your implementation of the countdown timer using the `/countdown` route and the `playerTimer` function is functional. It decreases the timer value by 1 each time the route is accessed and returns the remaining seconds in the response. However, I recommend making the timer value separate from the global `timer` variable to avoid confusion and potential issues.

Fetching questions from a database using the `getQuestions` function demonstrates your ability to interact with external resources asynchronously. This is crucial for handling data retrieval and storage in real-world applications.

In the `/game` route, you've effectively handled user input and checked the answers using the `checkAnswer` function. It correctly compares the user's answer with the correct answer and updates the timer, score, and question status accordingly.

One suggestion I have is to use more descriptive variable names throughout your code. While some variable names like `score` and `playerName` are clear, others such as `checkedResult` and `processed` could benefit from more expressive names to improve code readability.

I also recommend utilizing error handling consistently throughout your code. For example, when reading files or making database queries, it's important to handle potential errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages to the user.

Finally, the `finalScore` and `uploadResults` functions provide a nice touch to the game by calculating the player's final score and saving it in the database. This adds a competitive aspect to the game and allows players to track their progress.

Overall, I'm impressed with the quality of your code and the features you've implemented in the game. With a few minor improvements such as variable naming and error handling, your code will become even more robust and maintainable.

Keep up the good work, and I look forward to seeing more of your projects in the future!
